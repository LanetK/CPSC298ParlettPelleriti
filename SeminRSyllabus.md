## Overview:
This is an introductory course designed to introduce students to the R programming language. Syntax, as well as common functions for data analysis and visualization will be covered.

## Prerequisites:
NA

## Units:
1

## Required Text:
NA

##  Course materials:
All course materials will be made available via Blackboard and/or Github

##  Grading (subject to change):
Your Grade is based on 3 things: Participation Quizzes, Project Presentation, and Project Writeup.

### Participation Quizzes
Every Other Week will have a very short participation Quiz. You will get points if it is completed. If you miss a quiz, up to 1 quiz can be made up by submitting a fun R or Stats related joke/meme with at least 3 sentences explaining why it is funny in the context of R/stats.

### Project (general)
Your project should pick a data set that is interesting to you. You will explore, clean, analyze and visualize your data. Each project must have at LEAST 1 summary of the data, 4 "analyses" (we'll cover what that means in class), and 4 visualizations.

If you want to work with another person, you may,  but the number of analyses and visualizations will remain 4 per person (so for a 2 person team, 8 analyses, and 8 visualizations). If you work with another person it should be because it's a larger project. You must check with me before forming a group.

### Project Presentation
Everyone will give a 2-5 minute (per person) "lightening Talk" on your project.

### Project Writeup
Each person will turn in a write up of your projects Describing your Data (what is it, where did you get it), methods (which tests/summaries/visualizations did you use?), and your interpretation of the results and why they're interesting. Must be at least 3 pages, double spaced (size 12 TNR font, figures are included in length).

You have much to learn from your classmates, and so I encourage you to discuss and study course material together. However, all work you submit for this course must be your own, and must be completed individually unless otherwise specified. More specifically, you may not present source code or programs copied from the Internet, other texts, other students, etc as your own work. Of course, you are free to use whatever reference materials you like, but please cite them in a README turned in with your assignments. I assume you are familiar with Chapman’s policy on academic misconduct is presented below and any incidents of academic misconduct or dishonesty will be dealt with severely in accordance with this policy.

Over the course of the semester, you may experience a range of challenges that interfere with your learning, such as problems with friend, family, and or significant other relationships; substance use; concerns about personal adequacy; feeling overwhelmed; or feeling sad or anxious without knowing why.
